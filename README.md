# Notes Carbon design icons

Based on the [Notes 64x64 icons: IBM Carbon design + HCL backgrounds](https://github.com/nashcom/notes-dbicons-carbon), the goal here is to convert **icons** instead of **pictograms**, to be used in outlines, action bars and inside forms in general.

## Batch convert icons

Follow the instructions provided in the original repo.  
Color can be only provided in **hex format**, such as:

`convert_all_images 0066B3 32`

To create 32x32 icons in the Notes primary blue color.
